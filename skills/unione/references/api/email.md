# UniOne API: Email

Generated from the UniOne Web API spec. Every method: `POST https://api.unione.io/en/transactional/api/v1<path>` with the `X-API-KEY` header and a JSON body.

## POST /email/send.json

Sends an email or a bunch of emails

While sending you can provide substitutions (merge tags), use a template, turn on read or click tracking, etc.

Restrictions:
* maximum request size is 10 MB
* maximum number of recipients is 500
* The symbol '/' is not allowed in attachment names

If the list of recipients contains invalid, non-existent, duplicate, or unsubscribed emails, those emails will be returned in the output parameter failed_emails, and the email will be sent to all other valid emails addresses. If all the emails addresses fall into failed_emails, sending will not be carried out and API error 204 will be returned.
