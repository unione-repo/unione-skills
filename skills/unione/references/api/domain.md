# UniOne API: Domain

Generated from the UniOne Web API spec. Every method: `POST https://api.unione.io/en/transactional/api/v1<path>` with the `X-API-KEY` header and a JSON body.

## POST /domain/get-dns-records.json

Returns info on domain DNS setup for using with UniOne.

In order to send emails you have to confirm that you own the domain that you are going to send emails from and setup DKIM signature for the domain. This method allows you to register your domain in UniOne and generate verification record and DKIM key, or return previously generated ones if domain is already registered.
You should add then DNS records like this to all of the domains you want to confirm:

`@             IN TXT "unione-validate-hash=483bb362ebdbeedd755cfb1d4d661"`

`us._domainkey IN TXT "k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDo7"`

`@             IN TXT  "v=spf1 include:spf.unione.io ~all"`


- First record value should contain "verification-record" field returned by get-dns-records method "as is".
- Second record value should contain "dkim" field value after "p=". Mind the name of this record! "us._domainkey." prefix is important for DKIM selector of UniOne to work properly.
- Third record contains optional, but very recommended SPF entry. Probably you already have one, then just add append include:spf.unione.io right after v=spf1.

Syntax requirements of different DNS providers may differ:
- sometimes it's necesarry to put full domain name instead of @ sign.
- some providers require add TTL value (like 3600)
- some providers don't require quotes for enclosing values
Please check requirements of your provider and advice your users to do it.
