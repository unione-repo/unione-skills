# Email best practices for UniOne

```
[Signup form] → [Validation] → [Double opt-in] → [Consent stored]
                                                       ↓
[Suppression check] ← [Queue + idempotent send] → UniOne email/send
                                                       ↓
                               [Webhooks: delivered / bounced / spam / unsubscribed]
                                                       ↓

## Start here

- **New app:** plan the emails ([transactional-emails.md](references/transactional-emails.md)), authenticate the
  domain ([deliverability.md](references/deliverability.md)), then send.
- **Spam problems:** authentication first, then complaints and bounces, then content.
- **Marketing email:** consent and unsubscribe ([compliance.md](references/compliance.md)) before the first campaign;
  a separate subdomain or project for marketing.
- **Production readiness:** queue + idempotence + webhooks ([sending-reliability.md](references/sending-reliability.md)).
- **Transactional and marketing on one account:** separate projects, or an own unsubscribe URL for transactional
  mail — otherwise a marketing unsubscribe blocks password resets
  ([transactional-emails.md](references/transactional-emails.md)).
